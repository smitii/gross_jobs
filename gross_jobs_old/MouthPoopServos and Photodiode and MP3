/*
--Mouth Servo--
Servo at the mouth that closes door after 
QTR Reflectance Sensor detects a food ball.
Reopens after the food has processed 
and another food ball can go through.

--Poop Servo--
Poop balls stored in a hopper above a disc#1 with one hole.
Servo will move disc#1 at 0 degress directly under hopper to 90(or other) degrees,
so that it is above the visible poop compartment and poop ball drops there.
A disc#2 below disc#1 with enough space between the two to allow transportation
of only one poop ball.
Poopservo first gets signal from the mouth IR sensor. 
From the time that it receives a LOW signal, it will wait ____ sec 
to drop one or ___# of poop balls.
